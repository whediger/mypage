    <div id="about-me">I was born and have lived in Colorado most of my life. My first interest
      in programming computers was in 5th grade. I studied computer science at
      UNC. I've also lived in
      an art gallery on Santa Fe, run small businesses
      and lived in an isolated cabin in the mountains. Most recently I ran
       Stellaâ€™s Coffee House and started going camping. I enjoy
       learning/experiencing new things and I like to cook but closer to the
       truth is that I love to eat!</div>
